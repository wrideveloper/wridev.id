## Brief Introduction

The **UI/UX Design Miniclass** is a training program that explores the world of digital product design by combining **visual design (UI)** with **user experience (UX)**. This program uses **Figma**, one of today’s industry-standard design tools, ensuring that the skills you gain remain highly relevant in professional environments.

The training materials are structured to be easy to follow—from beginner to proficient level. You will learn essential Figma features such as **Auto Layout** and **Components**, which help streamline and optimize your design workflow. The curriculum covers everything from building a **Style Guide** to creating fully **interactive Prototypes**.

Don’t be discouraged if you feel you’re not good at drawing or don’t have an artistic background. This miniclass is designed specifically for **beginners**. Your mentor will guide you in understanding the difference between **UI (interface)** and **UX (experience)**, while introducing **Design Thinking** methods so your designs truly address user needs.

Great design isn’t just visually appealing—it’s also intuitive and comfortable to use. In this class, you’ll learn how to create clean, consistent designs that meet professional standards. UI/UX design skills are among the most in-demand competencies in today’s technology industry.

So, what are you waiting for? Join the **UI/UX Design Miniclass**! Prepare your ideas, open your mind, and let’s design the future of digital experiences together—experiences that are both stunning and solution-oriented.
