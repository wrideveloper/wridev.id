## Brief Introduction

The **Game Development Miniclass** is designed to turn your hobby from being just a *player* into becoming a *creator*. In this program, you will explore the fundamentals of game development using **industry-standard tools**—**Unity** as the game engine, and **Blender** and **Aseprite** for visual asset creation. The experience you gain will closely mirror real-world professional game development workflows.

This training emphasizes **hands-on practice** and offers a reminder that game development is not one-size-fits-all. Through a unique **Sub-Class system**, you can choose a learning path that matches your interests. Are you a logical thinker who enjoys controlling game mechanics through **C# scripting**? Or are you a creative mind eager to design iconic **2D or 3D characters**? The curriculum adapts to your chosen role, whether it’s logic scripting or asset creation.

No prior game development experience is required. This miniclass is designed for **beginners**, with mentors ready to guide you from the ground up. You’ll learn industry workflows in a relaxed, supportive environment without unnecessary pressure.

To simulate a real game studio experience, the program culminates in a **Game Jam**. You’ll collaborate in teams of programmers and artists, combining code and visual assets to produce a **playable game prototype**. This final project highlights not only technical skills, but also teamwork, communication, and collaboration—essential skills in the game industry.

So, what are you waiting for? Join the **Game Development Miniclass**, explore the vast world of game creation, choose your role, and bring your dream game world to life!
