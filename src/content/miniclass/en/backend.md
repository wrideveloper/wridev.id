## Brief Introduction

The Backend Development miniclass is a training program designed for IT students to learn the fundamentals of system logic development using **PHP and MySQL**, aligned with industry standards. In this program, you will gain essential backend skills that are widely used in real-world applications.

You might think, *“Backend development is boring—just lines of code.”* However, this miniclass emphasizes a **hands-on and practical approach**, where you will immediately start building system logic. You will learn how to design clean database structures, connect websites to servers, and create interactive features such as data manipulation (**Create, Read, Update, Delete**) and complex data relationships.

No prior coding experience? No problem. The Backend Miniclass is designed specifically for **beginners**. Whether it’s your first time hearing terms like *“Query”* or *“HTTP Method”*, our mentors will guide you step by step. You’ll learn programming logic in a relaxed environment while still producing meaningful results.

What makes this miniclass even more exciting is that you’ll understand how data works in real-world scenarios. Through various case studies, you’ll sharpen your logical thinking and gain insights into what it’s like to work as a **Backend Developer**.

So, what are you waiting for? Join the Backend Miniclass and become the skilled programmer behind powerful applications!
